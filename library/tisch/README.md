`tisch` provides a bit of sugar on top of the great Opaleye to make its usage a
bit more straightforward, safe and manteinable.

`tisch` was previously known as `opaleye-sot`. TODO: tell funny story about why
the library is called `tisch`.

Build this project using [Nix](http://nixos.org/nix) with `nix-build ./default.nix`.
